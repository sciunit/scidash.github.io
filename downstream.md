### SciUnit is intended to be used with domain-specific implementations of models and tests.  

### Here are some examples of the ~20 libraries that provide these implementations and are used in scientific projects.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="neuronunit.html">NeuronUnit</a> is a reference implementation of a SciUnit-based
package for testing physiological models of neurons and ion channels.  It implements an interface to several simulators and model description languages, handles test calculations according to domain standards, and enables automated construction of tests based on data from several major public data repositories.</p></p>
