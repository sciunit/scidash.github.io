### SciUnit and discipline-specific libraries support testing and visualization of test results.  How can interested communities find these tests and their results?  

### We are developing a [**SciDash portal**](http://dash.scidash.org) to identify test repositories on GitHub and make it easy to locate them, execute the tests locally or in the cloud, and visualize results online.
