## Scientific models are *formalized hypotheses* that can make predictions about system behavior.
## How can we evaluate the strength of a candidate model, or select the best model among several competitors?

## **SciUnit** enables the reproducible execution and visualization of *data-driven unit tests* for assessing model quality.

What if every competing model was transparently evaluated against a suite of unit data-driven tests?</p>

## **SciUnit** aims to make validation of scientific models against experimental data easy, transparent, and continuously integrated into the model development process. It is the scientific method for 21st century scientists.
