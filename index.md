### Good scientific models are *formalized hypotheses* that can make predictions about system behavior. How can scientists evaluate the strength of a candidate model, or which one is best among many such models of the same system?

### **SciUnit** enables the reproducible execution and visualization of *data-driven unit tests* for assessing model quality.  It is a 21st century vision of the scientific method.

What if every competing model was transparently evaluated against a suite of unit data-driven tests?</p>

## SciUnit aims to make validation of scientific models against experimental data easy, transparent, and continuously integrated into the model development process.

Some other projects using this technology can be found [here](https://github.com/scidash/sciunit/network/dependents?dependent_type=REPOSITORY), including [NeuronUnit](/neuronunit.html) for neurons and ion channels.

## Let's identify the best models together!
